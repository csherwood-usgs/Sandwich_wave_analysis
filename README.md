This contains Matlab code used for analysis of the wave modeling at Sandwich

This repo resides in my ../2015_Sandwich/CCBay_Modeling folder on my desktop.

The original version was set to run in this order:

1. `analyze_topo_maps.m`
2. `capecodbay_anal.m`
3. `scatterplot_anal.m`

I refactored the code to read in results from multiple model runs, now called `alonshore_transport.m`. This replaces `capecodbay_anal.m`.
